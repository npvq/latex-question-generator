# Sympy Implementation

This was the attempt at using Sympy and randomly piecing together functions to create problems. The difficulty was uncontrollable, and sometimes, sympy was not able to solve the problems, which lead to the program crashing a lot. (there was no recursion depth moniter)

Therefore, the program will still have to be made the old fashion wayâ€“manually.
