# Parser

This is a parser that's meant to convert plain text to LaTeX, and latex back to plain text. The latter should be easier than the former.

### Notes:

* This parser was meant to be simpleâ€“for functions. This was not meant to be a unicode/LaTeX parser. Therefore, it will ignore functions that isn't used, and it will ignore subscripts as there is no feasible textual representation for it.
* Just to note, this method will fail "newlines" as well. It's purely for parsing simple math expressions.
